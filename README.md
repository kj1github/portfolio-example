## Table of Contents

### Week 1 – [Hyperparameter Grid Search](./1-hypertuning-gridsearch/summary.md)
A summary of the first week, focusing on systematic hyperparameter exploration using grid search.

### Week 2 – [Hyperparameter MLflow](./2-hypertuning-mlflow/summary.md)
An overview of experiments tracked and analyzed using MLflow.

### Week 3 – [Hyperparameter RNN](./3-hypertuning-rnn/summary.md)
Exploration of recurrent neural networks (GRU vs. LSTM) and their tuning process.

### Week 4 – [Hyperparameter Ray](./4-hypertuning-ray/summary.md)
Findings from advanced hypertuning with Ray Tune — comparing Random, Bayes, HyperBand, and HyperOpt.

### Week 5 – [Deployment](./5-deployment/summary.md)
Demonstration of a deployed machine learning model, accessible via an interactive interface.

### [Hackathon Model: Project Cuddlefish](./6-hackathon/project_cuddlefish.md)
Our award-winning model that predicts the optimal camouflage pattern for a cuttlefish based on its environment.

### [Ethical Reflection](./7-ethics/summary.md)
A critical exploration of the ethical implications of AI-driven camouflage and model accountability.
