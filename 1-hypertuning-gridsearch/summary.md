change the number of epochs, eg to 5 or 10 -> 
Default with 3 epochs, accuracy is 
changing the amount of units1 and units2 to values between 16 and 1024. Use factors of 2 to easily scan the ranges: 16, 32, 64, etc.
changing the batchsize to values between 4 and 128. Again, use factors of two for convenience.
change the depth of your model by adding a additional linear layer + activation function
changing the learningrate to values between 1e-2 and 1e-5
changing the optimizer from SGD to one of the other available algoritms at torch (scroll down for the algorithms)
